# IVOA CodeOfConduct
This repository is intended to host a discussion about adopting a common CODE_OF_CONDUCT and Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) in all of our [IVOA](https://github.com/IVOA) and [IVOA-std](https://github.com/IVOA-std) projects.

Specific questions to discuss:
1. The general rule of including a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file in all the projects in the [IVOA code](https://github.com/ivoa) and [IVOA standards](https://github.com/ivoa-std) collections.
   * We already have a copy of our code of conduct on our [website](https://www.ivoa.net/members/IVOA_Code_of_Conduct.pdf).
   * This step would explicitly raise the visibility placing it at the top level of all our projects.
   * Using the de facto standard filename, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, means it can be recognised by automated documentation tools. 

2. The general rule of including a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) file in all the projects in the [IVOA code](https://github.com/ivoa) and [IVOA standards](https://github.com/ivoa-std) collections.
   * IVOA projects may accept contributions from a wide range of sources, ranging from employees of IVOA member institutes to private individuals.
   * The copyright of an individual contribution remains with the author or their employer, but the licence and publication terms of the project may be set by the IVOA.
   * The IVOA needs to have something to assert that the contributor has the right or permission to submit the contribution, including the intellectual property it is based on, to the IVOA project.
   
3. A process for updating our code of conduct based on the [contributor-covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) developed by the [Organization for Ethical Source](https://github.com/EthicalSource/contributor_covenant).
   * Like software licenses, the general concensus is that it is better to use prior art wherever we can, rather than writing our own.
